# website_inspirations.repo
This is repo to keep track of all the sites that inspired me to create my website along with the features I liked in them.

Years ago, it was HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) which was my first introduction to the world of various computer languages. I wanted to be a Front End Web Devloper when I got into tech. I know that having out own websites can be very fulling in terms of personal creativity, professional branding, and digital Sovereignty. Back the early days people all over the world have the thrill and wonder of creating their own websites with AOL Geocities, then MySpace and Tumler as well. Sadly on the modern web we have lost much of our creative power. Sure we can share images, videos and text, but we are limited to how these modern social media websites look and fucntion. I'm no longer focused no being a Front End Devloper, now I'm in Cybersecurity with a focus on Linux System Adminstration. Yet I have even more passion and gratitude than when I started my tech journey. Firstly, I'm going to build this website for myself, I'm going to add features, content and code I think is cool. As a secondary it will be used to as a hub for my life, both professional and personal. When people meet me and ask for my social media, I'll tell them to go to my website first, then from there they could find me on the other platforms. I'm going to start with raw html and maxing out all I can with those tags, I've been falling in love with terminal web browsers such as Lynx, Elinks, Links2 and W3M. Espeically since I saved this old Dell Lattitude D610 from a limited Windows XP and now it's on Lubuntu and I'm doing everything from the terminal. Later on I'll add CSS and Javascript to explore more and make the site more interactive. I may start hosting through github pages, but after tha I'm most likely going to self host the site. 

The intent of this site is to document and share more of my life and energy in a space I've created, and also help me express myself more creativly and professionally. 

Let this be love letter to all the humans who have helped create electiricty, computing, programming, the internet, and web browsing exist. When I was young I used to say I wish I was born in a different time. Now today with the internet, I'm glad to be alive. It's a perfect time to be alive.

I really admire the old aesthetic that geocities had, I loved how expressive eveyone's page was and how their was so much personailty, this site showcases all of that beautifully

On the extremly minimal side of the specturm is Richard Stallman's site. I admire it and this is most likely where I will start so I can quckly acesss my website via terminal web browsers.

I came across pink pantresss website and love how she has so much color and moving parts to it, also on the bottom left their was a "illeagl" text popping in and out on the bottom right and once I clicked it, it gave me a free mp3 ringtone which is pretty cool. 

https://pollinator-park.virtual-world.europa.eu/

Pollinator Park is a 3d interactive guide/game that highlights the enviromental impacs we are having on the bees and nature. It has a lot of VR (virtual reality) elements and most likely has a ton of javasccript in the background. I'll element all of that later on in my websties development. 

https://ar-code.com/

This site lets you copy 3d AR (Augmented Reality) models and implement them into your real world via your phone camera, they have come really far. I'm proud of them.

I completed this course on Saturday the first of october two thousand twenty two. I remember Jen Simmons being so passionate about Semantic html and not just using divs everywhere. She also was very serious about web accessibility, I have to remember make sure people with disabilities can access understand and enjoy the site as well.
